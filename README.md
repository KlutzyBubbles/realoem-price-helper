# RealOEM Price Helper
Ah, RealOEM, saviour of BMW enthusiasts worldwide.

Unfortunately, their listed prices are often wildly inaccurate, or even missing for some parts. Copy-pasting dozens of part numbers into vendor websites is incredibly tedious, so I'm doing the Thing here where I spend way more time automating a task than I'd spend just continuing to do it by hand.

This is a Chrome extension to automatically insert current prices for all parts, along with direct links to purchase them.

As of right now, [Cars245.com](https://cars245.com) is my favourite seller, so it's the only one that's supported.

## TODO
- [x] Fetch Cars245 prices and links
- [ ] Correctly handle DOM parsing with the single available offscreen instance
- [ ] More thorough error handling
- [ ] Cache results locally
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Fetch individual shipping costs
- [ ] Support more stores, with price comparison
- [ ] Aftermarket part alternatives
